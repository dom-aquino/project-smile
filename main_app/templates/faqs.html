            6. How can I maintain good oral hygiene at home?
            Maintaining good oral hygiene is essential for your overall dental health. We recommend brushing your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, flossing daily to remove plaque and food debris between teeth, and using mouthwash for added protection against bacteria. Additionally, a balanced diet and avoiding tobacco products contribute to healthy gums and teeth.
